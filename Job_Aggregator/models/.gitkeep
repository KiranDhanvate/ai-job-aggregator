# Models Directory

This directory contains trained ConvFM models and related files.

## Files Generated During Training:

- `best_convfm_model.pt` - Best trained model weights
- `convfm_model_[timestamp].pt` - Timestamped model versions
- `training_history.json` - Training metrics and history
- `model_config.json` - Model configuration parameters

## Usage:

Models are automatically saved here during training and can be loaded for inference:

```python
import torch
from ml_models.convfm_model import ConvFMJobRecommender

# Load model
model = ConvFMJobRecommender(...)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('models/best_convfm_model.pt'))
```
