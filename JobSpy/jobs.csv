ProductNow is building the world’s best operating system for AI\\-native teams, where agents and humans align, build, and ship together. Our mission is to solve the hardest problem in execution: alignment. Today, fragmented tools, workflows, and endless meetings are what teams rely on to get on the same page. We believe there’s a better way.


We’re creating an AI\\-native execution operating system: a unified workbench with virtual teammates (PN agents) that offload repetitive tasks, capture organizational context, and help teams accelerate execution. By getting people aligned more quickly, ProductNow empowers humans to focus on what matters most: creativity, judgment, and collaboration.


Our first step is to meet users where much of their work already happens: in documents. We’re reimagining the document experience from the ground up, with LLMs at the core. The result is a unified, AI\\-native writing platform that, when paired with PN agents, blends human creativity with intelligent virtual teammates. These teammates generate content, capture context, and remove busywork—creating a faster path to alignment and a more joyful way of working.

**In this role, you will**

* Build and ship end\\-to\\-end features across the stack, from frontend interfaces to backend services and APIs.
* Own projects through the full lifecycle – from early design discussions and technical scoping, to implementation, testing, and iteration post\\-launch.
* Work closely with product and design partners to translate ideas into intuitive, performant, and scalable user\\-facing experiences.
* Contribute to system architecture, ensuring the stack is reliable, maintainable, and able to scale with product needs.
* Explore and learn new technologies across both frontend and backend, applying them pragmatically to deliver value.
* Balance velocity with technical excellence – knowing when to ship quickly and when to invest in long\\-term quality.
* Grow by learning from senior engineers, while taking initiative to independently tackle problems and propose solutions.
* Uphold a collaborative team culture, sharing knowledge and best practices with peers.

**You may be a good fit if you**

* **Experience:** 1\\+ internship or project\\-based experiences in software engineering, ideally touching both frontend and backend. (Full\\-time professional experience not required.)
* **Technical skills:** Comfortable with at least one frontend framework (e.g., React, Next.js) and one backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django, or similar). Some familiarity with databases (SQL/NoSQL) and API design.
* **Product focus:** Excited about shipping features that directly impact users and iterating quickly based on feedback.
* **Ownership mindset:** Brings initiative and accountability, pushing projects forward and taking responsibility for outcomes.
* **Learning\\-first attitude:** Curious to deepen expertise in fullstack development and broaden exposure to new tools and architectures.
* **Collaboration:** Thrives in cross\\-functional work with PMs, designers, and engineers across disciplines.
* **Adaptability:** Comfortable moving across layers of the stack depending on the project’s needs.
* **Inclusive mindset:** Values different perspectives, creates space for input from others, and helps foster a positive team culture.

**Logistics**

* **Education:** Bachelor’s degree in a related field, or equivalent practical experience.
* **Location:** Hybrid — we’re in the office in Palo Alto, CA near the Caltrain station from **Tuesday to Thursday**, with **Mondays and Fridays remote**.
* **Visa:** At this time, we are unable to sponsor new visas, but we encourage you to check back soon, as this may change.
* **Inclusivity:** We encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet every single qualification. We prioritize strong working relationships, mentorship, and giving people opportunities to grow, especially with today’s rapidly evolving AI tools. Diversity is at the heart of our engineering team, and we know you’ll feel that when you meet us.
